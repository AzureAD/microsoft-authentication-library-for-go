// This example demonstrates how to create the managed identity client with system assigned
//
// A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure resource (like a VM, App Service, or Function).
// Azure automatically creates this identity and ties it to the lifecycle of the resource — it gets deleted when the resource is deleted.
// Use this when your app only needs one identity and doesn’t need to share it across services.

// https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#system-assigned-managed-identity

	_ = systemAssignedClient // Use this client to authenticate to Azure services (e.g., Key Vault, Storage, etc.)

}

// This example demonstrates how to create the managed identity client with user assigned
//
// A user-assigned managed identity is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to one or more Azure resources.
// User-assigned identities: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#user-assigned-managed-identity

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("failed to create client with user-assigned identity: %v", err)
	}
	_ = userAssignedClient // Use this client for authentication when stable or shared identity is required
}

// Client Capabilities ("cp1", etc.)
// 'cp1' is a capability that enables specific client behaviors — for example,
// supporting Conditional Access policies that require additional client capabilities.
// This is mostly relevant in scenarios where the identity is used to access resources
// protected by policies like MFA or device compliance.
// In most cases, you won't need to set this unless required by your Azure AD configuration.
